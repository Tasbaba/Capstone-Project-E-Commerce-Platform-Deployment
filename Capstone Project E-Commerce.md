## Capstone Project: E-Commerce Platform Deployment with Git, Linux, and AWS

### Project Introduction
I am assigned to develop an e-commerce website for a new online marketplace, and the should be "MarketPeak". The platform should feature product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication. I am to utilize git for my version control, develop the platform in a linux environment, and then, deploy it onAWS EC2 instance.

### 1. Implement Version Control with Git
#### 1.1 Initialize Git Repository
I started the project by creating a directory and named it "MarketPeak_Ecommerce", and I initialize a Git repository inside the directory to help manage the version control via the use of Git.

I lunch the git, and navigate to the directory where I intend to create the project directory, and I used the "mkdir" command to create the directory inside the directory, as shown below.

    - `mkdir MarketPeak_Ecommerce`

I have to use the change directory "cd" command to enter the directory and also use the "git init" command to initialize the Git repository to manage my version control as show below.

    - `cd MarketPeak_Ecommerce`

    - `git init`
